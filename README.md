## Pneumonia-Detection-Using-CNN

Pneumonia is a prevalent and life-threatening
respiratory infection, especially among
vulnerable populations. Early and accurate
detection of pneumonia can significantly
improve patient outcomes by enabling timely
intervention. In this project, we employ
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - a
class of deep learning models - to develop an
automated pneumonia detection system
based on chest X-ray images.
The primary goal of this project is to leverage
the capabilities of CNNs to distinguish
between normal chest X-rays and those
indicative of pneumonia. We curate and
preprocess a dataset of chest X-ray images,
extracting essential features to facilitate
model training. Our CNN architecture is
designed to optimize pneumonia detection
performance, taking advantage of transfer
learning to accelerate convergence.
Through rigorous training and evaluation, we
demonstrate the CNN's proficiency in
detecting pneumonia cases with high accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, we
developed a user-friendly Graphical User
Interface (GUI) to empower medical
personnel with a practical tool flask for
quick and intuitive pneumonia
assessment.
Despite the accurate results we achieved,
we have also encountered certain
limitations in our approach, including
dataset size and potential overfitting
concerns. As such, we propose avenues
for future research and enhancements,
such as exploring larger datasets,
employing data augmentation techniques,
and fine-tuning hyperparameters for
further performance gains. Our pneumonia
detection system aims to complement
existing clinical practices, aiding medical
professionals in making well-informed
decisions and improving patient outcomes.
